# Public Health Bioinformatics (PHB) WAPHL
Bioinformatics workflows for characterization, epidemiology and sharing of pathogen genomes. This is the Washington State Department of Health Public Health Lab fork of the Public Health Bioinformatics repository created by Theiagen.

**More information about the steps undertaken in these workflows is available via the [Theiagen Public Resources Documentation](https://theiagen.notion.site/Theiagen-Public-Health-Resources-a4bd134b0c5c4fe39870e21029a30566).**

Support for running these workflows can be sought by raising a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/theiagen/public_health_bioinformatics/issues/new) or by contacting Theiagen at support@theiagen.com. For workflows ending with WAPHL please contact [Holly Halstead](mailto:holly.halstead@doh.wa.gov).

These workflows are written in [WDL](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl), a language for specifying data processing workflows with a human-readable and writeable syntax. They have been developed by [Theiagen Genomics](https://theiagen.com/) to primarily run on the [Terra.bio](https://terra.bio/) platform but can be run locally or on an HPC system at the command-line with Cromwell or miniWDL.
